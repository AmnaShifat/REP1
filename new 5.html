<h2>VCS IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<h3>CREATING REPOSITORY</h3>

<p>The git init command creates a new Git repository.
It can be used to convert an existing,unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize anew, empty repository.Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository,
so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains
all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository.This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. A HEAD file is also created 
which points to the currently checked out commit.Aside from the .git directory, in the root directory of the project, an existing project remains unaltered (unlike SVN, Git doesn't require a .git subdirectory
in every subdirectory).By default, git init will initialize the Git configuration to the .git subdirectory path.The subdirectory path can be modified and customized if you would like it to live elsewhere. You can set the $GIT_DIR environment variable to a custom path and git init will initialize the Git configuration files there. Additionally you can pass the --separate-git-dir argument for the same result.
A common use case for a separate .git subdirectory is to keep your system configuration "dotfiles" (.bashrc, .vimrc, etc.) in the home directory while keeping the .git folder elsewhere.

 <p>The git add command is used to add file contents to the Index (Staging Area).This command updates the current content of the working tree to the staging area. It also prepares the staged content for the next commit. Every time we add or update any file in our project, it is required to forward updates to the staging area.

The git add command is a core part of Git technology. It typically adds one file at a time, but there some options are available that can add more than one file at once.

The "index" contains a snapshot of the working tree data. This snapshot will be forwarded for the next commit.

The git add command can be run many times before making a commit. These all add operations can be put under one commit. The add command adds the files that are specified on command line. </p>

<p>The git status command is used to display the state of the repository and staging area. It allows us to see the tracked, untracked files and changes. This command will not show any commit records or information.

Mostly, it is used to display the state between Git Add and Git commit command. We can check whether the changes and files are tracked or not.</p>

<p>It is used to record the changes in the repository. It is the next command after the git add. Every commit contains the index data and the commit message. Every commit forms a parent-child relationship. When we add a file in Git, it will take place in the staging area. A commit command is used to fetch updates from the staging area to the repository.

The staging and committing are co-related to each other. Staging allows us to continue in making changes to the repository, and when we want to share these changes to the version control system, committing allows us to record these changes.

Commits are the snapshots of the project. Every commit is recorded in the master branch of the repository. We can recall the commits or revert it to the older version. Two different commits will never overwrite because each commit has its own commit-id. This commit-id is a cryptographic number created by SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) algorithm.</p>

<p>The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to .gitconfig text files. Executing git config will modify a configuration text file. We'll be covering common configuration settings like email, username, and editor. We'll discuss Git aliases, which allow you to create shortcuts for frequently used Git operations.
Becoming familiar with git config and the various Git configuration settings will help you create a powerful, customized Git workflow.The most basic use case for git config is to invoke it with a configuration name, which will display the set value at that name. Configuration names are dot delimited strings composed of a 'section' and a 'key' based on their hierarchy. For example: user.email</p>
